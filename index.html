						<h3> Early Life </h3>
						<p>Juan Ponce De Leon
						was born in 1474 in Santervas De Campos, Spain. Santervas De Campos
						was a very small hillside town with a population of only around 130!
						Juan was born into a poor but noble family. Boys born into noble
						family's had to learn to be knights, For this reason his parents sent
						him to live and train with a nobleman named Don Pedro Nunez De
						Guzman, Juan then began training to be a page. Over the years Juan
						learned how to help Don Pedro prepare for battle. Juan was among the
						crowds when the Moors were defeated, Now there would be no more need
						for knights. Now Juan would have nothing to do. Little did he know
						that there was someone could help him, his name was Christopher
						Columbus. Juan Joined Christopher in September of 1493. Juan was
						aboard One of Seventeen ships. They Passed and claimed several&nbsp;small
						islands until landing on their final destination of Hispaniola on
						November 18th. Columbus left 40 people on Hispaniola to settle years
						ago, when he came back they we're all dead. The Spaniards pushed the
						natives to work and search for gold. Juan quickly learned how hostile
						Spaniards we're to the natives.
						</p>
						<h3>Hispanola and kids </h3>
						<p>
							Historians aren't sure what happened till 1502 in Juan's
							life, they do know however he moved back to Spain. He
							then met a man named Nicolas de Ovando who he sailed
							back with to Hispaniola's capital Santos Domingo. The
							Spaniards forced the natives to search for gold, which
							eventually caused an uprising. Juan was sent to take
							 the hostile Natives out, and he did. Nicolas de Ovando
							 Granted him govenor and gave him 200 acres of land.
							 Juan built a home and plantation there.In 1505 Juan
							 later founded a town named "Salvaleon" Juan got married
							 and had four kids in time, thier names were: Juana,
							 Isabel, Maria, and Luis.
						 </p>
						   <h3> Puerto Rico and First Voyage </h3>
						   <p>After years of
  						 finding success in Hispaniola, Juan was edged by King Ferdinand and
  						 the Spanish crown to search for more gold. Juan heard reports of an
  						 island nearby called Puerto Rico, so Juan decided to look there. He
  						 brought 50 men and a single ship, he landed where modern day San Juan
  						 is. He then set up mines in Puerto Rico. A year later Juan went back
  						 to Hispaniola to report his success. He brought his kids and wife to
  						 Puerto Rico. He found more gold there and set up more gold mines.
  						 Juan was believed to have had slaves, but treated them in a
  						 relatively nonviolent way. In 1512, King Ferdinand pushed Juan to
  						 look for new lands in hopes of finding more land for the Spanish
  						 empire. Shortly after Juan heard story's of a mystical island called
  						 Bimini, it was rumored to hold a Spring that could turn one to youth.
  						 Juan set out for the island in 1513, he had three ships and more then
  						 200 men, in a months time Juan Ponce de Leon landed on the east coast
  						 of Florida (Modern day Saint Augustine). Juan hadn't realized this
  						 was the mainland of America, Juan thought it was an island. He named
  						 it Florida because of its vast vegetation, also because he landed
  						 there near Easter Sunday. On the way back from Florida they found
  						 Bimini, however, it had no special water.
  						 </p>

						 <h3> Last voyage and death </h3>
						 <p>Juan left for Puerto
 						Rico after the discovery of Florida, when he returned to Puerto Rico
 						he found it in chaos, natives burnt down his house and settlement.
 						His family barely made it out alive. In 1514 he returned to Spain to
 						report on what he found. Juan was then named Military governor of
 						Puerto Rico and Florida. The Spanish crown ordered Juan to shut down
 						the Natives on Puerto Rico. Juan later learned that the king had
 						died, he hastily returned to Spain to Reclaim his titles and crowns.
 						Juan stayed in Spain for two years until he heard that Puerto Rico
 						was stable. In 1521 he Juan Ponce de Leon set off for a second voyage
 						and exploration. The crew soon landed on the western peninsula, where
 						they where attacked by natives, Juan was shot by a poison arrow to
 						his thigh. The crew quickly sailed to Cuba, where he then died in
 						July of 1521.</p>
